## Operations

JavaScript support the basic mathematic operators like:

- Addition
    ```javascript
    10 + 2
    // 12
    ```

- Subtraction
    ```javascript
    10 - 2
    // 8
    ```

- Multiplication
    ```javascript
    10 * 2
    // 20
    ```

- Division
    ```javascript
    10 / 2
    // 5
    ```

- Exponentiation
    ```javascript
    10 ** 2
    // 100
    ```

- Modulus
    ```javascript
    10 % 2
    // 0
    ```
    
- Incrementor
    ```javascript
    let a = 10;
    a++;
    // 11
    ```
    
- Decrementor
    ```javascript
    let a = 10;
    a--;
    // 9
    ```

#### Assignment Operators

- Equality
    ```javascript
    let a = 10;
    // 10
    ```

- Increment with
    ```javascript
    let a = 10;
    a += 10;
    // 0
    ```
    
- Decrement with
    ```javascript
    let a = 10;
    a -= 10;
    // 0
    ```
    
- Multiply with
    ```javascript
    let a = 10;
    a *= 10;
    // 100
    ```
    
- Increment with
    ```javascript
    let a = 10;
    a /= 10;
    // 1
    ```

#### The 0.3 "bug"

You may have heard about that ```0.1 + 0.2``` is not ```0.3``` in JavaScript. This is true, but, not only on JavaScript.

This "problem" is because that the language is doing floating point math (mathematics with binaries). You may find more information about this in https://0.30000000000000004.com/.
