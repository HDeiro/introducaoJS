## Types on JavaScript

JavaScript has dynamic typing. It means that the type of a variable is inferred by the value it holds.

The primitive types of the language are:
 - Number
 - String
 - Boolean
 - Null
 - Undefined

Besides the primitive, there are other type of variables. They refer to a sort of things but are interpreted as objects.
 - Objects
 - Functions
 - Arrays
 - RegEx (Regular Expressions)
