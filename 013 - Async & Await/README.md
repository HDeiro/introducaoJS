## Async & Await

These new keywords acts as facades to Promise handling but in a more implicit code.

There are a few rules 

In EcmaScript version 7 (ES7) a new way to work with asynchronous instructions has been introduced. This method includes two new keywords called ```async``` and ```await```.

An asynchronous function can contain an  ```await``` expresion that pauses the execution until the resolution of the promise received. After it, the function will resolve the promise returned value.

The ```async```/```await``` proposal is a merge of characteristics of the ```Promises``` and ```Generators``` (we'll talk about it later).
