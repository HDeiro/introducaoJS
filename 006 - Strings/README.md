## Strings

JavaScript has a rich API to deal with Strings. In this API there is a sort of methods to control case, do string replacing and a lot of other functionalities.

A string is a primitive type in JavaScript and it can be defined in three possible ways:

- Simple Quote String

```javascript
let string = 'String example n째 1'
```

- Double Quote String

```javascript
let string = "String example n째 2"
```

- Interpolated String

```javascript
// This row results the same as "String example n째 " + 3
let string = `String example n째 ${3}`
```
