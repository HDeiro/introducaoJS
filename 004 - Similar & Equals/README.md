## Similar & Equals

It's really commom the need to check if an value is equal to other one. But, considering that JavaScript is a language with dynamic typing, we may have to be careful about some value-checking.

In JavaScript we have two ways to check the equality, the ```==``` (Similar) and ```===``` (Equal). The Similar symbol checks about the value equality. When we use the Equal symbol, we check the value and the type equality.

The unequal follows the same rules. So, whe have ```!=``` and ```!==```.
